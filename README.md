# [Todo Odin Project](https://0xcire.github.io/odin-todo/)

Base todo app as instructed by Odin.

## Built with

- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript
- MVC Pattern

## Learning Points

- Working with localStorage
- Utlizing MVC pattern as a way to separate concerns.
- Allowed reusability of event handlers to consider accessibility for keyboard users.
- ID based matching for updating, deleting todos
- Something I now understand is similar to PATCH, DELETE and get<X>ById methods with REST and MongoDB

## Features

- Granularly updating UI elements based on state
- UI that follows user inputs, for a more intuitive UX
- app state is persisted through local storage - last viewed project / todos

#### remarks

Spent some extra time on this after creating the Odin weather app. I knew when I originally made this, and the subsequent weather project that I wasn't exactly utilizing best practices.

Came back to the todo app to refactor, added eslint(airbnb) to catch less glaring errors.
