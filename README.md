# Todo Odin Project

Base todo app as instructed by Odin.

#### remarks

Spent some extra time on this after creating the Odin weather app. I knew when I originally made this, and the subsequent weather project that I wasn't exactly utilizing best practices.

Came back to the todo app to refactor, added eslint(airbnb) to catch less glaring errors.

Refactored code a few times and added eslint.

Eslint is a good idea to have in general but especiialy for a beginner, or someone returning, it is a must. Very glad I added it, can't recommend it enough.

Going forward I plan to be much more efficient in my development process while being even more effective with that time. No more Ragu Code, hopefully.

- began refactoring
- added eslint
- refactored app.js flow
